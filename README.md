# DATA-WAREHOUSE-PYSPARK-SQL-SERVER-HADOOP-HIVE


🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

 Building a Scalable Data Warehouse using PySpark and the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver & Gold Layers)

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a modern data warehouse using PySpark, designed for analytical reporting and business intelligence.

Starting from SQL Server as the data source, I built a structured ETL pipeline that ingests data into a Bronze layer, processes and transforms it in the Silver layer, and refines it in the Gold layer for business analytics — all stored efficiently in Parquet format.

The entire architecture was deployed on a Hadoop ecosystem, leveraging Hive for data warehousing operations and SQL-like querying across distributed storage.

🔹 Key Features

✔ Implementation of the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers)

✔ PySpark-based ETL Pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading

✔ Data stored in Parquet format across all layers for optimized performance

✔ Integration with Hadoop and Hive for distributed data management and querying

✔ Star Schema Modeling (Fact & Dimension tables) for efficient analytical queries

✔ End-to-end data quality processing to standardize and validate datasets


🚀 Project Requirements

1️⃣ Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse

Objective:

Design and implement a scalable data warehouse using PySpark and the Hadoop ecosystem to consolidate data from multiple sources and enable high-performance analytics.

Key Specifications:

✔ Data Source: SQL Server (structured sales and CRM data)

✔ Bronze Layer: Ingest raw data from SQL Server and store in Parquet format

✔ Silver Layer: Apply data transformation and cleansing using PySpark; save as Parquet

✔ Gold Layer: Implement business logic and create aggregated datasets in Parquet

✔ Hive Integration: Enable SQL-based querying and metadata management

✔ Documentation: Include ER diagrams, schema definitions, and business logic flow



2️⃣ Business Intelligence & Analytics: Data Analysis

Objective:

Deliver actionable insights and business metrics through optimized querying and data modeling.

Insights Delivered:
